# Holodoro
My prototype is a smart physical device that assists students in studying using the Pomodoro technique. 

I have been using this technique to divide my study sessions into small, highly focused chunks separated by short breaks since I was fifteen years old. I have always wished for a system that would allow me to track this habit while also visualising and rewarding my progress in a meaningful way. 

This prototype is based on this concept and provides a complete system to accomplish that. 

**Features**
- Its main component is powered by an Arduino Uno and includes a holographic timer and alarm system (such the name Holodoro). 
- Semi-autonomous plant watering system that is watering the userâ€™s favourite plant based on their studying habits, powered by an Arduino micro. 
- Wireless component on this system located outside of the room that turns LED lights red whenever the user is studying, and green whenever they are having a break (do-not disturb feature). 
- System is mainly controlled using voice commands (NLP).
- Uses Firebase for its authentication and database purposes, and provides a web interface using p5.js.
- Other smart features include: measuring plant growth over time and generating a visual comparison. Automatic pause of a study session whenever the user leaves the computer, powered by ML.
